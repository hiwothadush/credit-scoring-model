# üè¶ Credit Score Analysis and Prediction  

## Overview  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of credit scores using machine learning techniques. It involves building a predictive model to classify credit scores and display insights using an interactive dashboard. The project helps financial institutions assess creditworthiness and make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns in credit score data.  
- Build a **machine learning model** to predict credit scores.  
- Visualize credit score factors using an interactive **Dash** dashboard.  
- Provide actionable insights to support financial decision-making.  

---

## Data  
- The dataset contains credit score information, including demographic, financial, and transactional data.

## Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
    - Cleaned and handled missing data using **Pandas**.  
    - Performed data transformation using **scikit-learn**.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
    - Visualized data using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to identify correlations.  
3. **Model Building:**  
    - Built a **Random Forest Classifier** for credit score prediction.  
    - Applied **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.  
4. **Model Evaluation:**  
    - Evaluated model accuracy using metrics such as **ROC-AUC** and **Confusion Matrix**.  
5. **Dashboard Development:**  
    - Developed an interactive dashboard using **Dash** and **Plotly** to display insights.

## Results  
- Successfully built a credit score prediction model with high accuracy.  
- Identified key factors impacting credit scores using feature importance.  
- Provided actionable insights through visualizations.
